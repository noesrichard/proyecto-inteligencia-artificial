# Color Recognition Project

This project is a color recognition system implemented in MATLAB. The system is designed to recognize colors from images and provide information about the dominant colors present. 

## Getting Started

To use this Color Recognition Project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Add all the project folders to the MATLAB path by running the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:

   ```matlab
   addpath(genpath(pwd))
   ```

4. You are now ready to run the color recognition system in MATLAB.

## Usage

To run the color recognition system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have added all the project folders to the MATLAB path.
2. Run the script or function in MATLAB that it's in the folder:  **application/main.m**

The color recognition system will process the input image and provide information about the dominant colors present in the image, such as their RGB values or color names.

## Requirements

The Color Recognition Project requires MATLAB to be installed on your system. The code is written in MATLAB and utilizes various MATLAB functions and toolboxes.
